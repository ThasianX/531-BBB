         with the dayAndLiftPickerCell prototype. The cell is populated using data obtained from the parent cell, or the cell above, that opened it.
        */

            /*Since the if clause wasn't executed, there can only be two reasons why: the picker index is nil or there is a picker index but it doesn't match the current
             index of the table. If the picker index is nil, then there can only be two reasons why: no rows have been selected yet or a row was previously selected but
             it wasn't a row that supported pickers. In either case, the cell at the current table index will be using the textFieldCell prototype. Then, the cell will be
             populated using data from the current lift at the cell.
             
             The other case is if the index of the picker is not the same as the current index. This would mean that
             for this cell at this row, we would want to use the textFieldCell prototype. Knowing this, the question now is how do we determine the correct lift to populate
             the data of the cell. To do so, a helper method, calculateLiftForIndexPath, is employed. The function is general so it can calculate get the right lift for
             any given index path, regardless whether the picker is showing or not and where it's located. However, for this situation, we know that the picker's index is not
             the same as the current table's index. So this means that the table index has to be below or above the picker's index. The helper method supports these two checks.
             If the table index is less than the picker's index, then we know that the index of the lift hasn't been displaced as the picker only displaces indexes larger than it.
             If the table index is greater the picker's index, then to determine the index of the lift, we just subtract the current index by 1 to get the correct lift to populate
             this cell.
             
             In both these cases, the first thing that happens is a cell with the textFieldCell prototype is created. Next, the proper lift to populate the cell with data is found.
             For the case when the picker isn't showing, the lift corresponding to the row of the table index is returned. When the picker is showing but the current table index is
             not the same as the index of the picker, we employ checks to determine if the current table index is above or below the picker index. This way, we can decide whether to
             use the lift corresponding to the current row of the table index or the lift corresponding to the row above the table index.

                 it makes sense that inserting the row for the new picker should just stay at the current index.
                 
                 But what if the index is less than the old picker index? As mentioned earlier, only the indexes greater than the old picker index were shifted down
                 one; indexes less than the old picker index remain the same. Therefore, the row to add a new picker would be the row right below the current index.
